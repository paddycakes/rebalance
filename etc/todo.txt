- Move bootstrap resource links out into Modules.groovy definition file and import into gsp or layout template....
- look at definition of why the createLinkTo tag is useful for locating resource
- sor out img resources as well, eg.
  (index.gsp): <img src="${createLinkTo(dir:'img',file:'logo.png')}" alt="logo" />

  Should I use <r: img> tag instead?
- sort out the images / img directories into one.
- see if there are any more resources required from 'measure' .. eg. artwork directory??

- need to sort out in head:
 <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700,900,300italic,400italic,700italic,900italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
- jquery js goes in head for some reason.
 
- TODO: Look at developer tool to inspect css when wanting to modify it

- // What URL patterns should be processed by the resources plugin
grails.resources.adhoc.patterns = ['/images/*', '/css/*', '/js/*', '/plugins/*']

- ** Try and run AdvertWise to see how code relates to look and feel ** 

- Put header and footer into a template file (instead of repeating on every page)

- Need to sort out main.gsp layout (especially as it looked like /login call was using the main layout instead of the login layout:

Caused by GrailsTagException: Error executing tag <r:layoutResources>: No module found with name [bootstrap-signin]
->>  18 | doCall  in /grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp

- I think slow to generate the login page because no internet connection and page contains:

<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700,900,300italic,400italic,700italic,900italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

- Sort out the logo home link on all pages:

          	<a class="brand" href="index.html">
                <img src="${resource(dir:'img',file:'logo.png')}" alt="logo" />
            </a>
            
- What should i do with the inline css in head on auth.gsp??

- Don't forget i have commented out the url to google fonts in head on auth.gsp / reset.gsp. What to do about these?

- Have added _header.gsp / _footer.gsp to layout templates. Make sure don't put a footer where don't want one (at moment 
they are not included in login.gsp or user.gsp but could be i suppose)


- Could i turn the <g:if test > tag on the tabs in expertise/index.html into it's own tag-library tag for DRY?
- How to make the tab-pane content visible when the tab is active on first page load?
