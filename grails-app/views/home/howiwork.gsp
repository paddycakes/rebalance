            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>My training is an integrative model. This allows me to draw from a wealth of knowledge, training and 
            experience from different therapeutic schools, and I can therefore tailor each session to your individual 
            need.</p>
            <p>My work is primarily through talking, but I find working creatively can help you to access deeper levels 
            of awareness. My work can include drama therapy, focusing, relaxation, and mediation when is appropriate.</p>
            <p>As well as face-to-face sessions, I also offer on line counselling via Skype both during the day and evening.</p>
            <p>I will encourage you to work at depth within out therapeutic relationships, in order to support you in 
            establishing rich and deep relationships within your life. I believe that being understood is a central part 
            of the healing process.</p>
            <p>I understand that the therapeutic process can be painful and difficult, as well as rich and rewarding and 
            I strive to work with compassion and empathy to create a safe, and holding environment for our work together.</p>
            
            <h3>Attendance</h3> 
            <p>It is important to come to the sessions regularly to benefit from counselling and psychotherapy. If you don't 
            attend regularly, or if you miss two sessions in a row without making contacts, I will not be able keep your 
            place open and you will still have to pay for the missed sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Completion</h3> 
            <p>If at any point you feel you wish to complete your therapy, you will be asked to give 2-4  weeks notice in 
            advance, depending on how long we have worked together. This is in order to have time to review the work we have done.</p>
            <p>May I suggest that if you think you may be interested in having some counselling that you make an appointment for 
            an initial session, where we can discuss your problem and how we might work together should you wish proceed. There would 
            be no obligation to continue and you would not be charged for your first appointment.</p>
