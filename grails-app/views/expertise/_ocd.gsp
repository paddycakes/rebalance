<h2>Obsessive Compulsive Behavior</h2>

<p>People whose lives are dominated by compulsive hand-washing or having to re-check the locks in their home often suffer from 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It usually involves obsessions (intrusive thoughts or impulses) and compulsions (repeated 
behaviours) such as washing, checking or counting to counteract them.</p>

<p>The repetition usually brings no pleasure, as addictive behaviours do, and is usually seen as irrational to the sufferer. 
Often it is an exhausting way of managing a fear and can be secretive.</p>
