<h2>Passive Aggressive</h2>

<p>We've all heard the phrase in books and films before, but what does it really mean to be 'passive aggressive'?</p>

<p>We often give this name to people who are particularly difficult, stubborn, unreasonable, or 'tight-lipped'. These people 
try hard to keep their real feelings inside but end up revealing them in subtle, under-hand but often far more destructive ways. 
Sometimes this can be accidental but more often than not, passive aggression is a perfectly intentional form of behaviour.</p>
