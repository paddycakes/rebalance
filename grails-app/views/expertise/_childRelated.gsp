<h2>Child Related Issues</h2>

<p>Sometimes children and young people (and their families) may need extra support if they are finding it difficult to deal 
with or understand their emotions and/or behaviour. Schools often provide professionals to help young people and their families, 
such as learning or behaviour mentors, family liaison officers or professionals from external services. However some children 
and young people, or their families, may decide to seek further help in the form of counselling.</p>
